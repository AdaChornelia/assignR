## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have:

* Removed 'sample.kind' argument in call to set.seed() to address warnings received when building under R 3.5.X
* Shortened runtime for examples in QA.Rd and plot.QA.Rd

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 x64, R 3.6.3
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 (on Travis CI), R 3.6.2
* Windows x64, i386 (on win-builder), R 4.0.0

## R CMD check results
No ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs 

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
